# TRANSFORM-Library
__TRANsient Simulation Framework of Reconfigurable Models__

A Modelica based library for modeling thermal hydraulic energy systems and other multi-physics systems

- This is the development site for the Modelica _TRANSFORM_ library and its user guide.

## Version - BETA

As library is in its beta stage, library may change often with compatability breaking changes. Thought you should know!

### Check that the Library is working

- To test that the library is working, run the appropriate `runAll_*.mos` script. This will simulate all the examples which are included in the regression tests.
