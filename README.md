__TRANsient Simulation Framework of Reconfigurable Models__


A Modelica based library for modeling thermal hydraulic energy systems and other multi-physics systems

- This is the development site for the Modelica _TRANSFORM_ library and its user guide.

Instructions for developers are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/ORNL-Modelica/TRANSFORM-Library/wiki).

## Version - BETA


As library is in its beta stage, library may change often with compatability breaking changes. Thought you should know!
